# cam-shift-tracking
Cam Shift Tracking is a Computer Vision algorithm

#If you want to use this script
In line 39 you have to put the local path to the input video

In line 51 you have to put the local path you want for the output

In line 58 you have to put the parameters of the initial region of interest (where the object you want to track is at the beginning of the video)

In line 71 you have to put the conditions for the hsv color of the object you want to track (if the background of the video has this color the algorithm could fail)
